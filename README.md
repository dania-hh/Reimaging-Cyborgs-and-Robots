Futurists predict that the future of AI foresees the emergence of AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, and soon after ASI, Artificial Super Intelligence. However, what about the future of AI that merges human and AI? Cyborgs, biological beings merged with artificial elements, can be the outcome of the mission to enhance the human through technology. But to what extent would we still be willing to consider the cyborg to be human? This project explores the visual aspect of this question using deepart.io's style transfer algorithm. Two sets of images are created: one set that explores the overlay of AI images as the style onto images of humans, and the second set explores the opposite. This project also introduces the idea of what are our visual image representations of AI. All work is documented on a website created using Cardd.co.
