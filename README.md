What does the future of enhancing human beings through AI look like, the future of the cyborg? Alternatively, what does the future of robots look like, considering the aim is to have them more closely resemble humans? This project explores the visual aspect of these questions using deepart.io's neural style transfer algorithm. Two sets of images are created: one set overlays AI images onto images of humans, and the second set explores the opposite. This project also explores image labelling: what images fall under the category of "Artificial Intelligence" through a Google search, who decides on these lablels, and what impact do they have on people's perception of what AI is? All work is documented on the website created using Cardd.co. </div>
